# Introduction

## 1. Programming Paradigms 
- A style or approach to problem-solving with programming languages; characterized by: 
    - Design focus 
    - Languages features and code organization 
    - Execution model of the language 
- Introduction to alternative programming such as:
    - functional
    - constraint-based
    - concurrent
    - logic programming

### 1.1 Programming Paradigm "Role in Software Dev"
- Problem solving approach guide 
- Code organization and structure 
- For maintainability and scalability of software 
- Affect learning curve for new developers 

#### Referential Transparency
- Given a function input value that can be changed but has the same output (result); *same entity*
